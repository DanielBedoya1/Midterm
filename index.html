            Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues of our time, and it is important that we take action to stop it. The impacts of climate change are already being felt around the world, from rising sea levels and more intense storms, to droughts and heat waves. These impacts can have devastating effects on communities, economies, and ecosystems. Furthermore, if we continue on our current path, the effects of climate change will only become more severe and widespread in the future. This being said, my groups project was a wakeup call for humans all around the world that climate change is real and really is happening, but there is ways of stopping and minimizing it.
